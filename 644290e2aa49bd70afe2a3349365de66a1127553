Then this would not work, as clang driver on linux expects asan runtime to be called libclang_rt.asan-x86_64.a and be located at lib/clang/$VERSION/lib with the other compiler-rt libs.\n\nIf this is a problem, maybe we could link without -fsanitize\u003daddress and specify our own library path. Even then, it should be a static library, as the dynamic ASan runtime on linux is not an officially supported configuration.",
