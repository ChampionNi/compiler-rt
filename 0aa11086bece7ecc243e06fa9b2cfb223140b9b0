      "message": "As of gcc 4.8 defining -mcpu\u003dcortex-a15 should set __ARM_ARCH_7S__ as true anyway - it should be set as true for all ARMv7-A and ARMv7-R cores (a+r \u003d s)\n\nI believe you want to use __ARM_ARCH_EXT_IDIV__ (which will also be set) to test for IDIV inline.",

      "message": "Unfortunately, gcc setting __ARM_ARCH_7S__ seems pretty broken to me. It is error-prone to set this when it really is only applicable to Apple\u0027s implementation. There are now patches in upstream LLVM that set __ARM_ARCH_EXT_IDIV__ for cortex-a15. I will cherry-pick/test those fixes and update AOSP when I have new prebuilts.",
